This is just a simple little ruby app I wrote to output the users IP in the JSON tree format. 

Simply deploy this app and go to /json and you should be able to see your IP.

== NOTES ==

Some systems like Heroku don't handle requests properly when they are running through their cloud. As a result you wil see the servers ip when you go to /json

== HOSTED ==

I modified the script a bit so that it can run on google appengine...
